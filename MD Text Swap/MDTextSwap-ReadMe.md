This script is designed to help you quickly and easily convert multiple `.txt` files to `.md` files, and vice versa, in a single operation.

# Text to Markdown and Back

## Benefits
- Saves time and effort when working with large numbers of files
- Easy to use and requires minimal user input
- Perfect for writers, developers, and anyone who needs to convert multiple files at once

## Why use .md files?
`.md` files, also known as Markdown files, offer a simple and flexible way to format text. They are:

- Easy to read and write
- Platform-independent
- Convertible to various formats (HTML, PDF, etc.)
- Widely supported by most text editors and platforms

Using `.md` files makes it easy to create and share documents, notes, and content with others.

## Usage
- Save this script as a batch file (e.g., `MDTextSwap.bat`).
- Run the script by double-clicking the batch file.
- Select the conversion option - to convert `.txt` files to `.md` or to convert `.md` files to `.txt`
- . The script will rename the files accordingly.

## Requirements
- Windows operating system
- Batch file execution enabled (usually enabled by default)
## Notes
- This script only renames files in the current folder.
- Make sure to run the script in the correct folder to avoid unintended file renaming.
- The script does not create backups of the original files.
