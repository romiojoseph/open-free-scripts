# Welcome to my collection of open-source resources!

Some workflows don't need to be complicated. As a non-coder, I use LLMs to create and share resources that simplify workflows and automate tasks. Inspired by Andrej Karpathy's concept of 10,000 hours, even projects that seem to go nowhere contribute to progress through exploration.

Also, here's a list of [free alternatives](https://romio.substack.com/p/free-alternatives-decentralize-tech-open-source)

### Important notes:

- I am a non-coder who uses LLMs (Claude, Mistral, Meta AI, ChatGPT, and Gemini) to generate scripts tailored to my needs. These resources are shared openly for anyone to use.
- Please keep in mind that I don't have formal coding knowledge, so the code structure, syntax, or best practices might not be optimal or conventional.
- I appreciate any feedback, suggestions, or contributions from experienced coders to improve these scripts and make them more efficient, readable, and maintainable.


Initially, I was hesitant about using terminal commands, fearing they could crash my Windows system. However, [my exploration of the Linux environment](https://romio.substack.com/p/repurpose-old-laptop-with-ubuntu-or-chromeosflex) sparked curiosity and helped me understand that scripting can be a powerful tool.

```bash
All I need to know is what I want, how do I want it, and the ability to properly convey that requirement to any LLM.
```

You don't need to fear using scripts, especially batch scripts (.bat). All you have to do is make sure it is coming from a trusted source and the code is publicly available, so that even though you don't have any coding knowledge, you can just copy paste it into any AI agent and confirm yourself. Also, with basic understanding, you can modify these scripts to fit your unique requirements.

> Windows might block the batch script from running. Just click 'More info' and then select 'Run anyway'.

- **Script**: Automating repetitive tasks saves time and effort.

- **Bot**: Bots fetch data and perform tasks on schedule.

- **Extension**: Simplifying tasks without switching tools or tabs.

- **Frontend**: These tools run quickly in the browser or locally.
