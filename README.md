## What are .bat scripts and why are they useful?
Batch (.bat) scripts are text files containing a series of commands that can be executed in the Windows Command Prompt. They are useful for automating repetitive tasks, such as:
- Simplifying complex commands or processes
- Saving time by automating tasks with a single click
- Creating custom shortcuts for frequently used commands
- Improving productivity by reducing manual effort


> Some workflows don't need to be complicated. When I find solutions using LLMs, I'll share them here as well.
