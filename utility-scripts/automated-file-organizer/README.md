*Script created using Google AI Studio.*

# Automated file organizer
No setup, no hassle! Just double-click this script and watch your messy directory transform into a perfectly organized space in an instant!

This folder contains two scripts to organize files in the same directory into categorized folders based on their file extensions.
- `automated_file_organizer.py (Python script)`
- `automated-file-organizer.bat (Batch script, for Windows users)`

**Choose the script that suits your preference.**
## Installation
If you choose Python script, ensure Python is installed on your system (download if needed). Simply save the script in the directory containing the files you want to organize.

## Usage
- .py - Run the script using Python command or double click.
- .bat - Run the script by simply double-clicking the file.

The script will create folders for each file category and move the corresponding files into those folders.
## Supported File Categories

## Notes
- Both scripts skip files without extensions.
- If a file with the same name already exists in the destination folder, the scripts append a number to the filename to avoid overwriting.
